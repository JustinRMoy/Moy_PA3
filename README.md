# Moy_PA3
For Moy_p1, my task was to create a math problem generator. The user will be given choices on what math they want to do(add, subtract, multiply, divide), 
the program will randomly select the numbers required and show you the equation. It will calculate the correct andswer and compare it to the one you typed. It will determnine if you are right or wrong and select 1 of the 8 
possible responses and print that response to the console.
